This repo is object-implementation in C language. Perhaps you will be wondering why not use C++ instead, and why "reinvent the wheel" because the repo's purpose is just simply to learn some advanced skills in C such as struct, function pointer, static function,...

  1. Abstraction: provide public attributes and methods such as: username and getPassword(). ✅
  2. Encapsulation: hiding private attributes and methods such as: password, encodePassword(), decodePassword(). ✅
  3. Inheritance: User class inheritanced C_String class (but no "protected" feature yet). ✅
  4. Polymorphism: maybe use function pointers and preprocessor directives [].
  5. Interface: maybe use header declarations and preprocessor directives [].
